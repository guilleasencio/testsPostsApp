# testsPostsApp
This is a Tests Posts App. I was developed by Guillermo Asencio SÃ¡nchez. You can contact with him via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillermoasencio/)

## Configuration

To run the project, you need to first install pods in the folder. To do that just run "pod install" from a terminal window placed in this folder.

Before running the project, check you have CocoaPods installed in your machine. If not, you can get more info about how to install in its  [website](https://cocoapods.org).

Please do `pod install --repo-update` so that your repository is updated before installing the Pods.

After that, lauch the project using the generated `.xcworkspace` file instead of `.xcodeproj`. You can also run Xcode from your terminal with his command:

`$ open testsPostsApp.xcworkspace `
